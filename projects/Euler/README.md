## [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/about)



From Wikipedia:
> Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.


My goal here is to practice and strengthen my TDD skills and explore the use of math and alfgorithms to solve these problems efficiently.

I hope to use these as a daily mental workout that will contribute to my success as an engineer.
