## [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/about)



From Wikipedia:
> Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.


My goal here is to practice and strengthen my TDD skills and explore the use of math and alfgorithms to solve these problems efficiently.

I hope to use these as a daily mental workout that will contribute to my success as an engineer.

>The Project Euler rules state that the code should produce the solution within a 1 minute time limit.
  This problem is the first to run against that useful constraint. For the first two, the simple approach was 
  fast. There may be a more efficient alogorithm for each of them, but the simple approach was so fast, that it 
  wasn't worth looking for. For Problem 3, I implemetned it with a simple, "brute force" algorithm. It found the
  answer, but it took over *90 minutes*!
